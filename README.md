# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Python
Car price prediction using machine learning and Python is a project that aims to estimate the price of a car based on various factors such as brand, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and engine specifications. The project includes with collecting and preprocessing a dataset from sources like Kaggle or car dealership databases. Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps in understanding the relationship between different attributes using correlation matrices and visualizations. Feature selection techniques are used to identify the most relevant factors influencing car prices. Various machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance. Finally, the best-performing model is deployed using Flask or Streamlit, allowing users to input car details and get price predictions. This project is useful for buyers, sellers, and car dealers to make data-driven pricing decisions.
